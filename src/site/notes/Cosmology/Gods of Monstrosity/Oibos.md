"The patience of a creeping vine", is an adage used by philosophers throughout history. Little did they know that this idiom was referring directly to an entity of immeasurable power. The sleeping willow, Oibos, Elder Sin of Sloth. Oisbos is not, despite what his portfolio would imply, lazy or inert. Oibos is indifferent, Oibos is patient. Unlike his brethren, he is not by any means in a rush to obtain what he wants. Be it 10 years or 10,000 years, Oibos is happy to lie in wait, monitoring the worlds through plants and nature that are just as patient as he is.

This approach is beneficial, as mankind often keeps vines and trees close  by for aesthetic and freshness. He uses this vantage to sew his seed into those mortals who live life slower than most, who value their own life's tempo above reaching the finish line. Slowly feeding on their lethargy and indolence until he can gain the means to claim it all for himself. Once the world dies, and all fades to dust, Oibos will remain.

When one feels the need to slow themselves when they look upon the coming day, they do so at the risk that if they look for too long, Oibos looks back.
