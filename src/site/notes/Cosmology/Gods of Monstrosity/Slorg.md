Gluttony is not a concept that limits itself to food and drink. Whilst those are the most common culprits, mankind has hunger for many things. Out of the sins, gluttony overlaps with all of them. Hunger for power, hunger for blood, hunger for carnal pleasure. Despite this, the other Elder Sins take no offence to this as even by Oibos' standards, the Elder Sin born from gluttony is Slorg the Consumer, who makes no effort to expand his reach to petty mortals. Slorg simply exists, manifested as a gargantuan being floating through the astral sea, consuming all that crosses its path. 

One would assume that because Slorg makes no effort to spread his Blighted Seed that his following would be minimal, however just like hunger itself, Slorg needs not make effort because with life comes consumption. To consume is to live and to live is to consume. He promises eternal satiation through merger and with that promise his followers find hope. They follow Slorg not because he commands them, but because they cannot help it. He can stop the hunger, he can make it go away. You can join him and never hunger again.

When one feels the pull from their stomach when they look upon a meal, they do so at the risk that if they look for too long, Slorg looks back.
