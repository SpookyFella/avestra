The oldest of the Elder Sins, Dehth'rhos represents the mortal sin of Pride. Spurred forth by the unfathomable depths of the astral plain, from the very wildspace itself, Dehth'rhos exists only to dominate and subjugate all that lies before it. It believes it is the one above all, with the gods of myth and man only existing as mere follies and pretenders.

Out of all the Elder Sins, Dehth'rhos is the least worshiped and the least present since the Elder War. Its form is never the same, but the constant as far as imagery is concerned is a giant glowing eye watching from just outside one's peripheral vision.

Dehth'rhos exists not in one place, but in every recess of one's mind where thoughts of  hubris and ego reside. In the darkest thoughts of man or the farthest reaches of space Dehth'rhos lurks and bides its time to return since its embarrassing exile at the hands of Yuan-shi. Its subjects; the Mind Flayers, Beholders and Aboleths, await the return of their master to take back all that is rightfully theirs, which is everything. 

When one looks up at the dark sky and allows their thoughts to wander, they do so at the risk that when they look for too long, Dehth'rhos looks back.
