When one thinks of a Barbarian's rage, or the scorned outburst of a hurt lover, not many think that those reactions fuel anything but pain. However at the source of every iota of anger is a single being, an Elder Sin that is by definition wrath itself. Gharrgov, the Conquerer, is that being. While all Elder Sins thrive through subjugation, Gharrgov has honed that purpose to a keen edge, taking advantage of the weakness of pain and anger within mortals to cleave the very spirit of mankind and prepare them for service under its hand. 

Gharrgov can be seen as fairly similar to the likes of Agran or Kharzath, in that it only exists for pain and destruction. However, even the god of blood Kharzath worships war with a modicum of honor. Gharrgov venerates war and destruction with no consideration for who it hurts, what it involves or when it happens, and will gladly eliminate all life if it could satiate its desire for domination. 

When one feels the tinge of rage when they look upon themselves, they do so at the risk that if they look for too long, Gharrgov looks back.
