In a world adorned with powerful individuals all capable of phenomenal feats of strength and bending reality itself to their will, it isn't difficult to see others and wish you were them. This feeling, this disease known as envy, can drive mere mortals mad. This feeling is what drives the Elder Sin of Envy, Impuku. Envisioned as a tangled swarm of rats, Impuku watches from the shadows through the eyes of his plagued subjects as mankind obsesses over what others can do that they can't. 

Impuku can always be found behind the dead eyes of vermin, creeping in the nooks and crannies of the wilds and cities throughout Avestra. His influence is the one felt relatively often due to envy being a very difficult to avoid feeling. His association with vermin is often paralleled with Gyaan, who similarly chooses rodents as his patron beast due to the reach they have when attaining knowledge. Due to this, the two of them can often be seen as mirrors to eachother, though Gyaan will always be quick to deny this.

Regardless, whenever one feels the longing to jump as high or run as fast when looking upon another, they do so at the risk that if they look for too long, Impuku looks back.
