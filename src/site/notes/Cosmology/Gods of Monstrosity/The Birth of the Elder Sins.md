7 generals of Hel wishing for more power aimed to kill Tasmatus the original god of Magic. The convergence weakened Tasmatus to a point where the generals could kill him and consume him and his power. This power allowed the generals to grow in strength to the point where their powers rivaled the gods and they rampaged, killing many gods.

Cragen, head of the pantheon at the time, defeated the new Elder Sins and banished them to the space between space, the void of the void. Locking them behind the Divine Gate.
