While all the other sins have a modicum of social acceptance, only one can only be indulged behind closed doors or under the cover of shadow, and that is the sin of lust. Scandalous by nature, and yet no mortal alive can resist its allure. The strength of lust is one not to be handled lightly and none do it better than the Elder Sin of Lust herself, Yuan-shi. Patron mother of all monstrosities and mutants, including the serpentine denizens of Ophidia the Yuan-ti, Yuan-shi takes the most direct approach when spreading the Blighted Seed of Lust. While not all Yuan-ti worship Yuan-shi, their disposition towards the carnal pleasures of this world provide The Den Mother with infinite opportunities to grow her influence. 

Apart from the city if Ophidia being a spreading ground for the sin of lust, Yuan-shi is not afraid to approach potential Children of Sin directly in order to coerce them into service. Those unwilling are often made willing, as no one says no to the Den Mother without consequence. Even the most pious of paladins can prove indifferent towards the serpent's gaze, and those who can are swiftly dealt with.

When one feels a fleeting, inappropriate thought when looking upon someone across the tavern, they do so at the risk that if they look for too long, Yuan-shi looks back.
