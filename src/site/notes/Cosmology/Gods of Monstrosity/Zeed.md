With divine, insurmountable strength, comes abundance. An abundance of power, an abundance of time, an abundance of followers. To be a god is to manage that power and to be content with your position above those who look to you for guidance. However with power comes corruption, the ever present feeling that what one has is not enough. A curse of avarice so strong that one would isolate themselves out of paranoia that those around you want to take what is yours. Those feelings, that curse, stem from the Elder Sin Zeed. Patron of greed, Zeed corrupts all that he touches as that is his right, for what he touches is his by nature. What is his by nature is never enough, so he will continue to take.

The natural sworn enemy of Grumbar's dwarves and in the past his dwarde, Zeed's creations the Goblins and the ancient Nimbistlin have spread throughout history in Avestra to covet what they have and to kill those who wish to take it. The Nimbistlin stole the sky from the Dwarde and from Grumbar, and the wild Goblins of Avestra have always taken in a vulture-like stupor when under Zeed's influence. All goblins are born with a Blighted Seed, which is unique amongst the Elder Sin's subjects. It is through incredible effort that they shed that burden, but even so Zeed pokes at their minds, furious that what was once his has been taken from him.

When one looks upon what they have with the urge that they must have more, they do so at the risk that if they look for too long, Zeed looks back.
