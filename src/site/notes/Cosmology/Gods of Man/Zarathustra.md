Zarathustra, the chief god of Avestra, stands at the nexus of its mythology, history, and the metaphysical forces that bind the universe together. He is revered not only as the architect of the material world but also as a tragic figure whose actions reshaped reality in ways even he could not have foreseen. His tale is one of sacrifice, ambition, and unintended consequences, leaving a legacy that continues to ripple through the fabric of existence.

### Origins and the Silent Plane

Zarathustra’s story begins in a time when magic in his universe was fading, a world starved of the vital energies needed to sustain its essence. Seeking a solution, Zarathustra ventured into the Silent Plane, a realm beyond comprehension where the last vestiges of creation’s power lay dormant. There, he encountered the Rubric—an enigmatic intelligence embodying the remnants of pure creation. Initially denied aid by the Rubric, Zarathustra resorted to a daring act of defiance. He stole the magic of creation itself, a decision that would ultimately split reality in two and birth the Convergence.

### The Convergence

The Convergence was the cataclysmic merging of the elemental planes with the material world of Avestra. Triggered by Zarathustra’s theft of creation’s magic and his subsequent spellwork to wield it, the event fractured the Ophestran Universe, creating a primordial scream that echoed across existence. The elemental chaos forged new regions within Avestra, each tied irrevocably to one of the elemental planes: Chalma (Earth), Linnea (Fire), Bavandar (Air), and Surulia (Water). The Convergence also formed a permanent nexus of pure elemental energy, a phenomenon both feared and revered by scholars and adventurers alike.

Zarathustra’s spell saved his world, but at an unfathomable cost. The land of Avestan, where the act was performed, became locked in a time loop—an eternal replay of the Convergence’s final day. Here, the Eye of Zarathustra resides, a point where travelers brave enough to journey across the axes of existence can glimpse the old world and perhaps harness its forgotten power.

### The Pilgrimage and the Relics

Reaching Avestan and the Eye of Zarathustra requires navigating through metaphysical axes laden with immense dangers. One can choose to enter the axes through a portal-way in one of the 4 nations. High magic, now rare and taboo in the post-Convergence world, is a necessity for this journey. Pilgrims often seek the aid of legendary relics tied to the Convergence, yet these relics break upon crossing into Avestan, their magic incompatible with the eternal loop. The Sages of Gyaan, scholars who devoted their lives to understanding the Convergence, chronicled such pilgrimages, though many perished in their pursuit of knowledge. Their work ensured the events of the Convergence were not forgotten.

### Pure Convergence Energy

The Convergence’s effects are not entirely dormant. Its nexus still emanates pure energy, a volatile and destructive force that can obliterate those who fail to harness it correctly. This energy’s destructive potential and its ability to power the Orb of Elemental Exchange make it a focal point for adventurers and mages seeking ultimate power.

### Zarathustra’s Eternal Vigil

Zarathustra’s theft of creation’s power left him burdened with the responsibility of maintaining the fragile balance he inadvertently created. The Creation Rune, a fragment of the Rubric’s magic, remains in his possession. It binds him to his universe’s fate; if the rune were reclaimed or destroyed, the universe itself would unravel. While the Rubric has seemingly abandoned any attempts to reclaim the power Zarathustra stole, the chief god remains ever vigilant. His efforts ensure that his people do not repeat his mistakes, instituting limits on magic—most notably the restriction of magic beyond the 9th level.

### Legacy and Worship

Zarathustra is worshipped as both a savior and a cautionary tale. He is a reminder of the perils of hubris and the responsibilities that come with immense power. His name is invoked in times of great need, and his story is a cornerstone of Avestra’s cultural and spiritual identity. Pilgrims, scholars, and adventurers alike are drawn to his tale, whether to seek his guidance, challenge his legacy, or unlock the mysteries of the Convergence.

In the end, Zarathustra’s actions were neither purely heroic nor villainous. He acted out of desperation to save his people, yet the ripples of his choices reshaped existence itself. To this day, the world of Avestra bears the scars and blessings of his fateful journey, ensuring that Zarathustra’s story will never fade from memory.
