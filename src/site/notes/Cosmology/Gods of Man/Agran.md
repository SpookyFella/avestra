The God of War Agran is the manifestation of all that is justifiably violent. War, honor and pride are what guides him and his followers, the Agranites. Agran was not the first God to hold his position, his predecessor was a god named Sogis, the arch-enemy of [[Cosmology/Gods of Man/Ahzul\|Ahzul]]. 

Before his promotion to the God of War, Agran the General was a mortal follower of Sogis. During a great battle in ancient [[Geography/Avestan\|Avestan]] Agran was felled, but not before slaying the leader of the enemy forces winning the war. Following his death, as was the way at the time, he was transported to Sogis' personal realm as recognition of his prowess. Sogis was dying as a result of a battle with [[Cosmology/Gods of Man/Ahzul\|Ahzul]]. He won but was gravely injured. So Sogis bestowed a gift to his greatest champion, giving him the title of God of War. 

Agran hated this, because he felt like he didn't earn it properly. He failed in battle and was given godhood? Pathetic. To alleviate this hollow victory, Agran developed a system he called the Battle Tally. 

Every being has their own Battle Tally, or Battle Score, however only followers of Agran see merit in keeping track. Every time a being in any realm claims victory in a battle either through the killing or surrender of their opponent, they inherit a percentage of their opponent's tally equal to their age. For instance if you defeat a 22 year old soldier in honorable battle, you claim 22% of their Battle Score and they lose that much. If you die, you keep your battle score after the percentage deduction for when you arrive in the afterlife. 

Battle Score also has a set of sub-rules governing its function. The battle must be honourable, and must be fought on equal grounds. Assassinations and dirty tactics are forbidden. If one is challenged to a Battle Dance, they must accept but have as much time as they would need to prepare. If your opponent surrenders you are to cease your advances.

Any such breaking of these rules not only forfeit the Battle Score you would gain, but all that you have accrued up until then. 

The Battle Score was created with a sole purpose, to find a warrior capable of killing Agran and taking his place. His ascension to godhood was judged to be unfit for a warrior, and he does not wish that on any of his followers. If you are able to accrue enough Battle Score to climb up through the 7 layers of [[Cosmology/Realms of the Cosmos/Hel/Hel\|Hel]], Agran waits at the top, prepared to die for the glory that was taken from him.
