In regards to the stigma that gods are cruel and ruthful in their interactions with mortals, Silvannah breaks that mold beyond recognition. A paragon of fairness, she holds an immense love for all living things. If not for her position of goddess of nature it is more than likely she'd be qualified as the goddess of life. However, as is the case with any scorned lover, Silvannah has had to go through drastic changes to preserve this vision of her.

Since the falling out with [[Cosmology/Gods of Man/Briganti\|Briganti]], Silvannah had to adapt her portfolio and responsibilities in order to take over the title of Goddess of Nature. Without [[Cosmology/Gods of Man/Briganti\|Briganti]], nature began to grow rampant and wild so Silvannah created several attendants to assist her. Beru, better known as the Overbear, was created to tame the wild spirits of the beasts of the world. Ramda, the goddess of the harvest, was created to oversee the relationship between mankind and nature. Finally, Aangdao was created to tend to the wind, allowing the natural water cycle and pollination to occur uninterrupted. With these attendants, Silvannah could handle the remaining aspects of nature with her full attention rather than neglect her portfolio by speading herself too thin.

This, naturally, infuriated [[Cosmology/Gods of Man/Briganti\|Briganti]] when she found out. She had always handled nature by herself without the assistance of anyone. This jealousy that Silvannah was managing her portfolio elgantly resulted in [[Cosmology/Gods of Man/Briganti\|Briganti]] constantly throwing natural disasters at the material plane. Silvannah, however, was unperturbed as her and her attendants could handle anything the goddess of storms through at them, and then some.
