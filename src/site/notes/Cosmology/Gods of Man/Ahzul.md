Ahzul was once a supremely good God, fueled by his position as the God of Kindness and Goodwill. His influence could even turn the mood of The God of War Sogis, his greatest friend. During his tenure as the God of Kindness however, Ahzul grew worried. Kindness was a very fleeting feeling that could be snuffed out with the slightest word. He was concerned that his power would wane just as quickly. 

Seeing how [[Cosmology/Gods of Man/Zarathustra\|Zarathustra]] and the other [[Cosmology/Concepts/Mortal Makers\|Mortal Makers]] created self-replicating sources of worship, Ahzul figured he would try it himself, despite warnings from Sogis that it was unwise. Ignoring the council of the God of War, Ahzul attempted to create life and the result was... not what he expected. Instead of creating life filled with kindness, Ahzul birthed the first Undead and marked the beginning of his decline. 

At first he saw this Undead as an abomination, until he discovered it could not perish. If he could somehow replicate this en masse, he could find the solution to his problem. The only issue was that the Undead had no minds, and could not worship or believe in anything. He remembered reading about how [[Cosmology/Concepts/The Gods of Myth\|the Gods of Myth]] gained belief through lineage and how the Elder Sins siphoned power from their subjects by force, and thought of how he could use these techniques himself. 

His first attempt was to embue the already created death with the feeling of joy, however their bodies and decayed minds could not handle it. Following that, he started experimenting on himself instead. If he can't create followers in his own image, he'll craft his image to match his creations. After years of experimentation he found something, a way to separate his divine soul from his body, and live on in Undeath.

Sogis, meanwhile, was growing concerned for his friend's state of affairs. His portfolio was suffering due to his obsession. He wouldn't allow someone he called a friend to fail, it was not something he could tolerate. He entered Ahzul's divine chambers to find a ritual shaking the realm, Ahzul ripping his divine soul out of his body and placing it within a phylactery. What phylactery would be large enough to contain a divine soul you may ask? Ahzul's entire demi-plane. 

Sogis could not stop the ritual, and the result was no longer Ahzul the God of Kindness, but Ahzul the Lord of the Undead. What followed was a battle, this was not the man Sogis knew but a monstrosity who killed his friend. Ahzul was defeated and killed, but not before casting a heavily injured Sogis out of his realm. When he opened his eyes, Ahzul realized he had succeeded, as he rose from the land, ready to spread his gospel of despair.
