As with all Gods of Myth, the origin of Reus the All-Father is left to assumption. Some say he was an Avestanian mortal who was so mighty he assumed godhood, whilst others say he was created by [[Cosmology/Gods of Myth/Drakaris\|Drakaris]] so that he could have a rival. Regardless of his origin, Reus has stood as a stalwart member of the Gods of Myth for as long as anyone could remember, with some speculating he could be as old as [[Cosmology/Gods of Man/Gyaan\|Gyaan]].

Reus can be seen as the most mortal of all the gods, with his ever-present desire for community and family. This wish was made possible when Reus visited the material plane himself, and from the very elements of the land, sea and sky he crafted his children; from the humble hills he molded the first Hill Giant Klodd, from the sheer cliffs he carved the first Stone Giant Tobyaas, from the raging flames he forged the first Fire Giant Zaltor, from the frozen bergs he chiseled the first Frost Giant Harshnag, from the soaring clouds he shaped the first Cloud Giant Durvaskar, from the raging storms he manifested the first Storm Giant Uvald, and from the mountains themselves rose the first Titan Zaraxis.

Reus, together with his newly created children, returned to their realm Ysgard, where they would live as a family in relative harmony, until familial bickering set in and the brothers began to argue for who was their fathers favorite. Growing tired of this, Reus declared that they were all to create their own children, and tie them to the mortal plane. Whoever's children was atop the heirarchy would have the largest seat at the table before Reus himself. Thus the various giants were created, and the second gargantuan denizens of Avestra arrived.
