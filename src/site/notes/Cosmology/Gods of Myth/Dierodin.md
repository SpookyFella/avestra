Dierodin is the patron deity of Magical Beasts and beast-aligned races such as Tabaxi, Aarakocra and Beastmen. While each of these races are free to worship whatever god they desire, the influence of Dierodin is why they are the way they are. A stern yet kind god, he values the natural order of the magical animal kingdom above all else. As is true for all nature-aligned gods, Dierodin has a tumultuous relationship with mankind, with the Beastmen being one of his only interactions with them considering mankindâ€™s frequent habit of hunting magical beasts out of fear or for sport.

Either way, to ensure a place in the Sacred Wilds, you must show yourself to align to his values of neutrality and love for the magical beasts he calls his children. It is speculated where Dierodin truly came from, however it is mostly believed that he is the very embodiment of natural instinct. The way a newborn calf knows how to walk or how a mouse can sense danger before it strikes is said to be whispered into the mind by Dierodin himself.
