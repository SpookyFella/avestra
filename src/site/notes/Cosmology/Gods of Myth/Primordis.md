With the land of old [[Geography/Avestan\|Avestan]] ravaged by [[Cosmology/Realms of the Cosmos/The Elemental Chaos/The Elemental Chaos\|the elemental chaos]] thanks to [[History/The Convergence\|the Convergence]], [[Cosmology/Gods of Man/Zarathustra\|Zarathustra]] and [[Cosmology/Gods of Man/Silvannah\|Silvannah]] put their combined power to use and came up with a way to quell the cataclym and repair [[Geography/Avestra\|Avestra]]. The two of them channeled the power of [[Cosmology/Realms of the Cosmos/The Elemental Chaos/The Elemental Chaos\|the elemental chaos]] into a being composed of all four elements in chaotic harmony, calling them Primordis. Primordis was sealed in the realm of [[Cosmology/Realms of the Cosmos/The Elemental Chaos/The Elemental Chaos\|the elemental chaos]] along with the calamity, giving them a chance to shape the realm into their image. 

[[Cosmology/Realms of the Cosmos/The Elemental Chaos/The Elemental Chaos\|The elemental chaos]], now under the influence of Primordis, is anything but chaotic under their rule. Seperated into embodiments of the four elements, each section of [[Cosmology/Realms of the Cosmos/The Elemental Chaos/The Elemental Chaos\|the elemental chaos]] has its own rules and denizens, and due to being unable to manage all four sections by themself Primordis split the load by manifesting the four minor gods of the elements; Charra the Kindled, Frigil the Void, Teran the Solid and Aerie the Free. Without the need to manage each section of [[Cosmology/Realms of the Cosmos/The Elemental Chaos/The Elemental Chaos\|the elemental chaos]], Primordis decided to let their children take a greater role so they could step back, so Primordis forever cemented their connection to their realm by merging with the very essence of elemental chaos and becoming the entire realm itself. Fire, water, earth and air will always contain a sliver of Primordis' influence, and they will forever be able to see the world through the eyes of the elements.
