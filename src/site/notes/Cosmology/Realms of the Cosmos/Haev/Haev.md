**Haev**

The Layers of Gold, as they are called, make up what the mortals refer to as Haev. [[Cosmology/Gods of Myth/Neriah\|Neriah]] organised Haev into these 7 layers of virtue to celebrate the goodness of humanity. Seen as a parallel to the seven layers of sin in Hel, these layers are referred to in common as Chastity, Temperance, Charity, Diligence, Kindness, Patience and Humility, however in Celestial they have their own names. When a mortal dies and is deemed majority Good by Cragen, they will be sent to the appropriate layer to spend their afterlife indulging in what they spent their life doing in pursuit of that virtue.

The Seven Layers of Virtue:

1. Castitia (Chastity)
2. Temperantia (Temperance)
3. Caritas (Charity)
4. Diligentia (Diligence)
5. Humanitas (Kindness)
6. Patientia (Patience)
7. Humilitas (Humility)
