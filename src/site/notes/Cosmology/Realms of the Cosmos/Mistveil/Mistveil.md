**Mistveil**

The Land of the Dead as the mortals refer to it, Mistveil is the domain of [[Cosmology/Gods of Man/Ahzul\|Ahzul]] the God of Undead. A barren, craggy wasteland covered with a perpetual mist, Mistveil contains scattered settlements that were once destroyed in the Material Plane that have since been preserved in their own afterlife. The denizens of these settlements are the spirits of the damned that were not wanted in the other planes. Those who followed no god and who rejected the judgement of Cragen. Liches, zombies, and spirits alike all make their eternal homes in Mistveil, waiting for the next foolish mortal to stumble their way through.

For those who visit Mistveil from other planes, they find they cannot stay for long at the risk of their soul slowly being diffused into the deadly mist, before eventually being left as a lifeless Husk.
