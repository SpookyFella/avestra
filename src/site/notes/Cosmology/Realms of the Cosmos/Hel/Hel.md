**Hel**

The brother plane to Haev, Hel is one of the destinations for mortals who pass through the Great Gates and are judged by Cragen. Similarly to Haev, Hel is subdivided into layers representing the prime sins committed by mortals. Their names match the sin's name in common as their original names match those of the Elder Sins, and speaking them would drive you mad. When one is damned to Hel when judged to be majority evil by Cragen, they spend their eternity overindulging in that sin, in a similar fashion to making your child eat cigarettes when caught smoking. Regardless of how much you enjoyed your sin during your mortal life, you will grow to hate the monotony of reliving that Hel every day for the rest of time.

The Seven Layers of Sin:
1. Lust
2. Gluttony
3. Greed
4. Sloth
5. Wrath
6. Envy
7. Pride
