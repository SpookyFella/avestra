**The Sands of Fate**

While many consider the Mirage Ad Infinitum in Linnea to be an infinite desert, that is merely due to it being an extension of the Sands of Fate. The Sands are a true infinite sandscape that can only be navigated through divine guidance. With dunes as high as mountains and sandstorms that rage for months the Sands of Fate are not to be trifled with, however they are the only way to [[Cosmology/Realms of the Cosmos/The Forest of Fate/The Forest of Fate\|the Forest of Fate]] and those who choose to make the perilous journey do so at unfathomable risk. However the benefits that one gains from traversing the Sands are immense, from the river of youth in [[Cosmology/Realms of the Cosmos/The Forest of Fate/The Forest of Fate\|the Forest of Fate]] to the Never Ending Market. [[Cosmology/Gods of Man/Farib\|Farib]]'s Pyramid is another treasure trove that many brave the desert to plunder, but it's not called the Temple of Bones for nothing.

**The Never Ending Market**

The Never Ending Market is a key location in the Sands of Fate. Home to a massive bazaar that is open to anyone from any plane, the market is a place where one can acquire anything they desire. The currency of the market isn't set, as anything can be trades. From gold, to paper, to fractions of a soul, there is much to be gained in the market and even more to be lost.
