**Cataclysma**

If the Water quadrant of the Elemental Chaos is seen as a stormy ocean, Cataclysma makes it look like a rippling pond. A plane of never ending storms and waters with waves so high they would eclipse the sun, Cataclysma is the home of the scorned goddess Briganti. A cruel mirror of her own psyche, only below the waves would you find peace, until the denizens of the infinite sea claim you that is. Home to some of the deadliest aquatic creatures in the multiverse, Cataclysma is sure to be a deathwish for any traveling to or through it.
