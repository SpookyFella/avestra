**The Hidden Garden**

A realm of pure nature, the Hidden Garden is a grove of wonder and secrecy that houses the secrets that power the flora of the cosmos. Fantastical and wondrous plantlife litters the garden and greets you with an alien yet familiar feeling of calm and peace. The Garden is not just a beauty display, as it houses dangers of its own. Vicious plant creatures and protective druidic spirits give the garden a way to fight back against aggressors, a contingency put in place by Silvannah after learning too harshly that letting your guard down is a surefire way to burn down everything you hold dear.
