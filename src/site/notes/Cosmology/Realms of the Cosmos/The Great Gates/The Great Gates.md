**The Great Gates**

When a mortal dies they likely expect to awaken straight into their afterlife, ready for an eternity of pleasure or torment. In Esselheim, however, if you're an unlucky soul without a promised afterlife then after your trip through the Hall of Life you wake up standing in line for judgment. At the end of the line are The Great Gates, a massive temple room containing pathways to every realm within the cosmos. In the middle, behind the Divine Gate, sits Cragen the Judicator ready to judge your soul. Once your fate is sealed, you are sent to Haev or Hel respectively. If you had an afterlife promised to you, you're instead led to the appropriate gate by a messenger of your patron god. One way or another, your fate lies beyond the Gate Gates.

Those being judged may request a Etterney to aid them in convincing Cragen to adjust his ruling. They may offer whatever they deem valuable as payment.
