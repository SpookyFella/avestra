**The Shadowfell**

A mirror of a mirror, the Shadowfell is truly a realm of doom and despair. Mortals and scholars have speculated that the Shadowfell is a cruel mirror of the Material Plane, emphasising  the darkness and melancholy of life. This, however, is a misconception. The Shadowfell is in actuality a mirror of the feywild, the wellspring of all the decrepit energy that the Feywild expels in order to keep its whimsy going. Zana created the Feywild as a home to all the childlike innocence in her heart, but where there is innocence there is corruption, so to preserve the magic that corruption was hidden and it became so potent it manifested an entire plane...The Shadowfell.
