**Cloudmount**

After losing the skies to Zeed when Grumbar found himself ruling the dwarde in Avestan, he did not miss his chance to bring that existence back to his people in the form of Cloudmount. A range of infinite mountains that seemingly have no bottom, blocked by colossal clouds, Cloudmount is home to Grumbar's Forge which is the place wherein the weapons of the gods are created. Scattered with djinni temples and other outsider settlements, Cloudmount is a difficult realm to navigate without a guide but getting to Grumbar's Forge is more than often worth the perilous journey.
