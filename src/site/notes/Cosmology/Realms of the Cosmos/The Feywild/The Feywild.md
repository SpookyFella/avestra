**The Feywild**

Born from the machinations of the Blightchild Zana, the Feywild is whimsical mirror of the Material Plane filled with fantastical creatures and impossible beings. A twisted view on reality that adheres to different rules, the Feywild is a dangerous place that betrays its own aesthetic. Eerie in a way, the Feywild is a little bit too happy, all the time. When travelers from other planes enter this space, they feel time slow and for every minute that passes in the feywild a day passes in the Material Plane. It's best to bring a feyclock to make sure you don't enter a dad and return a great grandfather.

**Feyblight**

Feyblight is an affliction that one immediately suffers from whenever they are in the Feywild. When one is infected with Feyblight their physical body will slowly decay over the time of roughly a month. The only way to delay this decay is to consume demetria fruit or its byproducts. The decay presents itself as flakes of your body peeling off and floating into nothingness. Beneath the flakes is not muscle or bone, but an empty void as if your body was hollow, and over time you'd be able to see through your body if the flakes line up properly.

**Demetria**

Demetria is a substance that is obtained from the Demetria Tree, a grand tree grown from pure magic itself that is suffused with an otherworldly grace. The products of the tree, be it its roots, fruit or leaves, are incredibly magical. Demetria Fruit specifically is the only way to deter the Feyblight, and as such it is a highly coveted resource that wars could be waged over. Outside of the Feywild, Demetria loses most of its magical properties which is a magical oddity that has stumped magical experts across Avestra as it only occurs with demetria and nothing else from the Feywild.
