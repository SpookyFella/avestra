**Ysgard**

The great mountains of Ysgard are a haven to all of giant kind and the home of [[Cosmology/Gods of Myth/Reus\|Reus]] and his children. The landscape is extreme and varied much like its denizens, with the Yggdrasil rooted firmly in the centre. While many believe Yggdrasil to be a tree that spans across the cosmos, in reality it is a tree sprouted from the remains of [[Cosmology/Gods of Myth/Reus\|Reus]]' wife Frygge, containing her pure magical essence. It is through Yggdrasil that [[Cosmology/Gods of Myth/Reus\|Reus]] can spread his influence to his children across Ysgard, her final gift to her family. Some roots do permeate into other planes, but only when a ritual performed through runic inscription allows a root to temporarily sprout. For those traveling to Ysgard they can expect similar tribulations to the Material Plane, albeit and obviously on a much larger scale.
