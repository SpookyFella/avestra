**The Library of Infinite Apprehension**

A monument to knowledge, the Library of Infinite Apprehension was once an all accessible temple dedicated to the pursuit of academic development. Following the convergence, however, the library was closed off to all but a select few. If one manages to gain access to the library, it holds information about anything and everything. Gyaan maintains the library on his own, and despite being a God he cannot work miracles in an infinite space and some wings of the library are run down and home to dangerous beings and unfathomable threats. The pursuit of knowledge is not without risks, after all.
