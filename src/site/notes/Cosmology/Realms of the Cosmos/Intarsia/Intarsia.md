**Intarsia**

A realm of pure, unfiltered magic, Intarsia is the origin point of not only the Weave itself but the entire sphere of Esselhelm within which Avestra is located. The home of the great god Zarathustra, Intarsia is where he watches the multiverse from and ensures that the measures he has put in place to keep Esselheim isolated stay in place. In essence, Intarsia is an infinite void of pure magic containing a magical laboratory/prison from which the multiverse is tended to. Those who manage to visit Intarsia will find it empty, as Zarathustra's fortress is hidden from even the godliest eyes unless he wishes.  

Within Intarsia one can see the very fabric of magic folding and unfolding, shifting and molding itself as it's channeled through the realms. If one were to happen to fall into this sea of magic, they would find themselves broken down and merged with the Weave, becoming one with magic. Perhaps they will be reborn as a Dancing Light or an Unseen Servant.
