**The Hall of Life**

When Hayata was formed from the merger between Javenna and Kemati, the goddess of cycles found herself without a realm. Neither Haev nor Hel accepted her. Rather than claim an entire dominion to herself Hayata created the Hall of Life, a demiplane within the Great Gates that allowed a mortal that has died to reflect on their life. Presented before them is a summary of every event of one's existence giving them the opportunity to reflect on their actions and potentially sway Cragen's judgment through genuine regret. Not only do they face every decision they've ever made, but should their spirits be willing the deceased's loved ones may also appear to either say a final goodbye or prepare for reunion. Denizens of the Hall of Life are free to stay as long as they like before judgement, however Cragen shows no patience for those who do so to avoid their fate.
