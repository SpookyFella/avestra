**Zormyr Sanctuary**

When the dragons were bested in the Amaranthine War, many believed them to have been killed off and pushed into extinction. The truth behind that is in reality [[Cosmology/Gods of Myth/Drakaris\|Drakaris]] answered the prayers of his children and sequestered them away in the Zormyr Sanctuary. A mountain range of immense size within which the concept of the word 'ground' is just that, a concept, the Zormyr Sanctuary was a haven for all dragonkind. With lairs scattered all over the countless mountains, the dangers that presented themselves for non-dragons were frequent and destructive. The Platinum Peak, [[Cosmology/Gods of Myth/Drakaris\|Drakaris]]' personal lair, could be seen from across the entire plane. The mountains reached the skies but the Platinum Peak pierced the very heavens themselves. Ever since the Amaranthine War, the Zormyr Sanctuary has been unreachable to all, with spells capable of planar passage or scrying merely perceiving a grey husk of what the grand plane once was, a true fall from grace.
