**Absolon**

The Land of Wheels. Absolon is the home of the God of Machines, Zeppeli. A sprawling, almost manufactured-looking grassland adorned with nothing but magnificent steel towers reminiscent of a modern city's skyscrapers albeit constantly shifting, moving and rotating through gears, tracks and conveyors. Across the land stride giant constructs with varied amounts of limbs and appendages carrying what seems to be manufacturing cargo and materials. Throughout the sky are occasional swarms of modrons and flying constructs. In the centre of this realm is the Prime Laboratory, Zeppeli's private sanctum within which he plans and constructs his latest creations and inventions.
