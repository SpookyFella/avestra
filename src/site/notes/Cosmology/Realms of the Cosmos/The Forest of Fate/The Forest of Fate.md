 **The Forest of Fate**

When one envisions a paradise, few anecdotes do not include a parallel with the Forest of Fate. A veritable oasis in the middle of the infinite desert of the Sands of Fate, the Forest of Fate is the home to the goddess Fila. Beautiful clear waters that can restore one's youth flow throughout the forest and from which beautiful evergreen trees grow. In the very centre is the Shining Palace from which Fila oversees her portfolio while waiting through her eternal gestation. Elves occupy the forest to guide well intentioned visitors whilst protecting the rivers of youth from interlopers.
