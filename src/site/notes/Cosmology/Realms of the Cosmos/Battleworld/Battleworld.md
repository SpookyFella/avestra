**Battleworld**

The scriptures of Agran describe your journey through Hel as the one you must take before fighting Agran himself. What Agran chose to omit was the fact that Hel was merely the first obstacle, and that when one passes that obstacle they merely enter the final challenge. Battleworld is an immense wartorn battlefield littered with the remains of thousands of history's greatest warriors who all converged to fight the God of War himself. However, before that they must survive eachother. Pitted in a battle royale until Agran decides to grace the battle with his presence, only then will the fittest need to survive to claim their prize or seal their fate.

There is no way to exit Battleworld once one enters it. The only way out is to win or to die, the latter of which deems you unworthy of a just afterlife and sentences you to an eternity as a Lemure devil.

**Brolysium**

While Battleworld is dedicated to the culmination of an Agranite's journey to fight Agran, it is also killer entertainment. That fact is the sole reason why a god of such an opposite disposition to Agran such as Brodysseus chose to host his realm there. Protected by a divine barrier that prevents entry directly into Battleworld, the denizens of Brolysium are free to get shattered to their hearts content without worry of falling into the battlefield.

The only entry into Brolysium is unknown to all, including Brodysseus himself, however it is said that if one gets drunk enough that they will eventually find themselves there while searching for a bathroom.
