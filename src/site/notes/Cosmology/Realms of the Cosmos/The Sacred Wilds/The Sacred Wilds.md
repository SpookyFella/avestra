**The Sacred Wilds**

A veritable paradise for all fauna, the Sacred Wilds is home to the spirits of beasts and Beastmen alike. A place where any animal can pursue its instincts for as long as it would like. The spirits of the deceased aren't the only ones who live in the Sacred Wilds, as many magical beasts choose to go there to live in peace away from civilisation. Non-animals may visit as well, however will find themselves slowly transitioning into an animal that closely matches their inner nature. [[Cosmology/Gods of Myth/Dierodin\|Dierodin]] is fiercely protective of the harmony within the Sacred Wilds, any dissent is dealt with simply and ruthlessly. Many adventurers and wizards choose the wilds as a retirement plan, living as an animal forever sometimes doesn't seem to bad.
