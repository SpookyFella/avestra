**The Elemental Chaos**

The true father of the convergence, and the very reason it happened, the Elemental Chaos is a plane of discord and tumultuous power. It was originally a tunnel through which the Weave was channeled. The magic of the world was balanced and calmed by the chaos, but when Zarathustra broke through the veil and attempted to merge with the plane that balance was broken and the chaos was mixed into a roiling catastrophe.

The arrival of [[Cosmology/Gods of Myth/Primordis\|Primordis]] and his creation of the elemental scions managed to sate the hunger of the plane for the time being, splitting it into 4 major quadrant demiplanes. Each of these demiplanes meld together at specific bordering points, creating quasi-planes in between. Traveling among and between these planes is an extremely dangerous concept, as each quadrant represents the total extreme of the environment it embodies.
