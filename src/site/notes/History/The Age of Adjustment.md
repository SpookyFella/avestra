When [[History/The Convergence\|the Convergence]] struck the land of old [[Geography/Avestan\|Avestan]], it was left unrecognisable in the wake of the elemental chaos melding itself with the elemental plane. For years it was so ravaged by the searing heat, freezing cold, rapid hurricanes and devastating earthquakes that it was inhabitable by even the hardiest creatures. The gods, sentimental as they are, needed the material plane repaired if they wanted to settle their own creations there once again. Silvannah, most of all, felt powerless without a world full of the nature she created and cared for most dearly.

[[Cosmology/Concepts/The Gods of Man\|The Gods of Man]] didn't trust the new god, and they definitely didn't trust his guidance until now. However, Zarathustra was sentimental and wished to repair his old home. When he petitioned the gods to assist him, the others didn't believe he had the power and were beginning to resign to the fact that they'd need to write Avestra off and begin anew.
