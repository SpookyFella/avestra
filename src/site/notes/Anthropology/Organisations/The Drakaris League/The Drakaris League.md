The Drakaris League is an organisation dedicated to documenting and preserving the memory of dragonkind. The League is composed of 15 royal houses, dating their lineage back to the Age of Titans and the Amaranthine War. These houses were, in one way or another, touched by draconic magic. Now, one individual per generation born into a house inherits their Dragonmark. These dragonmarks function identically to those found in the world of Eberron, granting the inheritor spells and abilities that their brethren don't have access to.

Some see them as a church to [[Cosmology/Gods of Myth/Drakaris\|Drakaris]] and his children. To some effect this is true, as the league do revere them as their primary deities.

The grand design of the Drakaris League is to investigate the disappearance of dragonkind following the Amaranthine war, as well as chronicle and archive known information regarding dragons. The end to which these means progress to is unknown, but some hear rumors of it being nefarious...
